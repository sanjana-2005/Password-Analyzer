# AI Password Strength Analyzer

An intelligent tool that analyzes password strength using AI and machine learning techniques to predict password vulnerability and provide actionable suggestions for improvement.

## Features

- Real-time password strength analysis
- AI-powered password suggestions
- Time-to-crack estimation
- Entropy calculation
- Pattern detection for common password vulnerabilities
- Modern, responsive UI
- Secure password handling (no storage)

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Flask
- TensorFlow
- Transformers (Hugging Face)
- Other dependencies listed in requirements.txt

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd password-strength-analyzer
```

2. Create a virtual environment (recommended):
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Start the Flask application:
```bash
python app.py
```

2. Open your web browser and navigate to:
```
http://localhost:5000
```

3. Enter a password in the input field to analyze its strength.

## How It Works

The tool uses multiple techniques to analyze password strength:

1. **Entropy Calculation**: Measures the randomness and unpredictability of the password
2. **Pattern Detection**: Identifies common patterns that make passwords vulnerable
3. **Time-to-Crack Estimation**: Calculates approximate time needed to crack the password
4. **AI-Powered Analysis**: Uses machine learning models trained on password datasets
5. **Smart Suggestions**: Provides specific recommendations for improvement

## Security Note

This tool is designed for password strength analysis only. It does not store or transmit passwords to any external servers. All analysis is performed locally in your browser and on your machine.
